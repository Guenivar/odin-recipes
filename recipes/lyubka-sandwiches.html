    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This is a special sandwich recipe that I have invented myself, after my wife's tastes. It is her favorite meal
        when there is nothing else prepared and the best part is that if there is an ingredient or two missing it's no
        big deal.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread: 2 pieces</li>
        <li>Onion: 1/2 small</li>
        <li>Cream cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Turkey slices</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step one:</h4>
            Thinly slice the onion and fry it up in a bit of butter and a little bit of salt.
        <li><h4>Step two:</h4>
            Spread some cream cheese on one piece of bread and put some pickles on it.</li>
        <li><h4>Step three:</h4>
            Cover the other slice of bread with some tomato and place 1-2 turkey slices on top of it</li>
        <li><h4>Step four:</h4>
            Put the onion on top of the pickels and close the sandwich.</li>
        <li><h4>Step five:</h4>
            Put the sandwich in the pan where the onion was and fry it in a bit of butter on low temperature to get
        it nice and golden and crispy.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>You can add a clove of garlic to the onion around 30 seconds before taking it out for some extra flavor. Enjoy!</p>
