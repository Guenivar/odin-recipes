    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favourite recipes to make, as it is easy to cook, cheap, fast and most of all DELICIOUS!
    </p>
    <p>It is an excellent dish to keep you warmed up during the winter, but it can also be served cold without 
        it taking away from the taste.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes: 1 kg </li>
        <li>Onions: 3 heads</li>
        <li>Carrots: 2</li>
        <li>Brine cheese: 300 grams</li>
        <li>Butter: 2 tsp</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step one:</h4>
        <p>First we need to prepare the ingredients. We peel the onion and cut it in fairly large pieces, putting 
            them in the pot that we'll be cooking in. Then we peel the potatoes (you can skip this step if you're 
            using white potatoes), wash them, and again put them in the pot. Finally we peel the carrots, cut them
            into, you guessed it, large pieces and put them in with the other veggies. </p></li>
        <li><h4>Step two:</h4>
        <p> Now we put enough water to cover all the vegetables in the pot and put it on the stovetop at high
            temperature. Here we add the salt and pepper to taste. Potatoes like a lot of salt. Let this boil until 
            everything is nice and soft (30-40 minutes should do it).
        </p></li>
        <li><h4>Step three:</h4>
        <p> Once everything is properly boiled we take the pot off the stovetop and blend the ingredients together.
            After we've achieved a humogenous consistency, we add the butter and the crushed cheese.
        </p></li>
        <li><h4>Step four:</h4>
        <p> Lastly we put the pot back on the stove on low temp for 5-10 minutes, stirring frequently. During that
            time we can taste test to check if more salt/pepper is needed. 
        </p></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Lastly:</h3>
    <p>You can serve as is, with parsley, some croutons, or both. Yum :)</p>
