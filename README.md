This is the first project I was given from "The Odin Project" web dev course.

It is a basic recipe website, without any styling, which will be used to show
the basic commands that I have learned so far.

I think the first recipe I'd like to include will be a potato cream soup, as this
is what I cooked earlier today and it is one of my wife's (<3) favourite meals.
